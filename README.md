- 👋 Hi, I’m @batonPiotr.
- 👀 I’m interested in software and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I'm interested in, without any specific order or plan.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on if some 3D Artists are looking for a C# Unity programmer, I'm open to start a game project. I have some ideas for gameplay and story but it's too large to do on my own.
- 📫 How to reach me: pawelsulik@gmail.com
